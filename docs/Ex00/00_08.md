# Task 08: Entra Identity Signals in Defender XDR (cloud-only prerequisites)


Identity investigations on Entra signals visible in Defender XDR (sign-in risk, token anomalies, OAuth app governance) rather than MDI sensors. Let's demonstrate:

 - Risky sign-ins & conditional access blocks
 - Risky OAuth consent (create a test multi-tenant app and flag it via App Governance)
 - Identity Secure Score improvements (enforce MFA, block legacy auth)

The output will provide evidence-based insight into how Entra risk telemetry flows into your unified XDR environment, and a baseline for later posture-hardening exercises.

> In a real-world scenario, Security Architecture would design, while a Security Admin could implement.

1. Open Windows File Explorer, then go to `‌‌‌C:\LabFiles\E0`.

1. Right-click **EntraXDR-Investigate**, then select **Run with PowerShell**.

1. Sign in with your global admin account.

1. On the **Permissions requested** dialog, select **Consent on behalf of your organization**, then select **Accept**.

    > Collects Entra ID risk telemetry (risky sign-ins, OAuth consent events, Identity Secure Score) and exports it to ./out for Defender XDR-style investigations, optionally generating report-only Conditional Access policy JSON and creating a harmless multi-tenant app stub when explicitly enabled.

1. Observe the outputs in `C:\LabFiles\E0\out`.
