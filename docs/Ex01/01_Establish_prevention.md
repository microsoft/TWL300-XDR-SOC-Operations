# Exercise 01: Establish a Prevention Baseline & Executive Visibility across MDO, MDE, MDI, MDA  

## Exercise learning objectives  

- Capture current-state baselines (**Secure Score**, **Exposure/Recommendations**, **email and endpoint posture**, **identity posture**, **cloud-app risk**).  
- Define a minimum viable prevention baseline (**Safe Links/Attachments**, **anti-phish**, **ASR rules**, **EDR in block**, **MDI sensors**, **app discovery and controls**).  
- Assign owners, SLAs, and measurable targets that answer, "How would we have prevented this?"  

**Estimated time:** 90 minutes  

===

## E01 CISO Overview - Scenario and goals  

Zava Oil & Resources is expanding rapidly but has uneven coverage across email, endpoints, identities, and cloud apps. You need to create a single, defensible prevention baseline deployable this week, and executive visibility to prove risk reduction (Secure Score up, exposure down, MTTR down).  

The CISO has asked:  
- The **Architecture Team** to define the minimum standard.  
- **Engineering** to implement and tune controls.  
- The **SOC** to validate signal quality and visualize blast radius in Defender XDR. 

### Expected outcomes  

1. A snapshot baseline (**Secure Score**, exposure, sensor/device coverage).  
2. Minimum controls enforced (**email, endpoint, identity, cloud apps**) within a pilot scope.  
3. A short executive deck/export proving coverage and measurable deltas tracked weekly.
