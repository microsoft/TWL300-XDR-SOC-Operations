# Exercise 02: Email-born Attack Defense with MDO (BEC/Phish → Prevent, Detect, Remediate)

## Exercise learning objectives  

- Configure **Safe Links** and **Safe Attachments** for time-of-click and detonation-based blocking.  
- Tune **anti-phish** and **impersonation protection**, and disable automatic external forwarding.  
- Use **Threat Explorer** and **Automated Investigation and Response (AIR)** to contain and remediate.  

**Estimated time:** 90 minutes  


## CISO Overview - Scenario and goals

Zava Oil & Resources is seeing an increase in Business Email Compromise (BEC) and credential-phishing attempts targeting executives and site managers.  

The organization must:  
- Harden email defenses using **time-of-click URL scanning**, **attachment detonation**, and **anti-impersonation** protections.  
- Block risky **auto-forwarding**.  
- Prove it can **investigate and purge malicious mail quickly** across tenants using the unified **Defender XDR** portal.  

Expected outcome: Executives' inboxes are protected, detection signals are validated, and remediation workflows are proven end-to-end.
