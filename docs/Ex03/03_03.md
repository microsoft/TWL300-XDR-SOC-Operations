# Task 03: Isolate a test device, run Live Response commands, collect artifacts, then de-isolate

---

## Security Architecture Team  

1. Establish when to use full isolation (for example, signs of lateral movement, credential theft, or ransomware spread) versus selective isolation (controlled drills or low-risk investigations).

1. Identify essential business apps (like Teams, Outlook, or service desk tools) that remain functional during selective isolation and add them to the allowed-services list for continuity.

1. Capture isolation criteria, exception rationale, and fallback plans in your security runbook or incident response policy to ensure repeatability and auditor-ready traceability.
