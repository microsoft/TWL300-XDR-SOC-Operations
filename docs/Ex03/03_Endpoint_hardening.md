# Exercise 03: Endpoint hardening and rapid response with MDE

## Exercise learning objectives  

- Enable and validate **Tamper Protection**, **EDR in block mode**, **PUA protection**, and core **ASR rules** via pilot groups.  
- Include Windows device security settings.  
- Practice **device isolation**, **file quarantine**, and **Live Response** actions.  
- Use **security recommendations** to reduce exposure and track improvement deltas.  

**Estimated time:** 60 minutes  

===  

## E03 CISO Overview - Scenario and goals 

Zava Oil & Resources recently experienced several endpoint-based security incidents caused by incomplete deployment of Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE) and inconsistent Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) settings across devices.  

The CISO wants to validate that **Tamper Protection**, **EDR in block mode**, and **ASR rules** are enforced through a pilot group before global rollout. The goal is to harden endpoints, reduce exposure, and measure improvement in **Secure Score** and **Mean Time to Respond (MTTR)**.  

Establish a defensible endpoint-protection baseline across managed Windows devices, ensure rapid containment through isolation and Live Response, and demonstrate measurable improvement using **Defender XDR's unified exposure dashboard**.
