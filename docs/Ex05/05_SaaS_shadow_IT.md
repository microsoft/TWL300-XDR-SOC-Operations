# Exercise 05: SaaS shadow IT control with MDA (MDCA)

## Exercise learning objectives

## CISO Overview - Scenario and goals

Zava Oil & Resources faces a growing security concern as sensitive corporate data is being exposed through unauthorized file-sharing and unmonitored AI-based SaaS applications adopted by frontline employees. This uncontrolled SaaS sprawl introduces significant **regulatory**, **compliance**, and **intellectual property (IP)** risks to the organization's data estate.  

Your objective is to operationalize **Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps (MDCA)** by:  

- Activating **Cloud Discovery** to identify all shadow IT applications in use.  
- Classifying each application as **sanctioned** or **unsanctioned**.  
- Enforcing control over risky behaviors using **Conditional Access App Control**.  

By completing this exercise, you'll establish measurable SaaS governance and assign ownership and accountability for each app category.
