# Exercise 07: Automatic attack disruption and Conditional Access response tuning  

## Exercise learning objectives  

- Examine the behavior and requirements of **Automatic Attack Disruption (AAD)**.  
- Optimize automated isolation and containment responses while aligning communication procedures for affected users.  
- Establish native, built-in response workflows that minimize **mean time to respond (MTTR)** without relying on custom playbooks.  

**Estimated time:** 40 minutes

## CISO Overview - Scenario and goals

Zava Oil & Resources is piloting Microsoft Defender XDR's **Automatic Attack Disruption (AAD)** to reduce response times from minutes to seconds when ransomware or business email compromise style credential abuse is detected. 

Today's drill validates prerequisites and scope, automated device and user containment behavior, a built-in, product-native fallback leveraging Conditional Access for high sign-in risk, and evidence collection for root cause analysis and executive reporting on MTTR and actions taken. The target outcome is a measurable reduction in MTTR and clear accountability for response owners without relying on custom runbooks.
