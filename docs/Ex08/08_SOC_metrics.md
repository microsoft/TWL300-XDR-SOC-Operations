# Exercise 08: SOC metrics and triage quality

## Exercise learning objectives  

- Align **incident classification and severity**, define **MTTR**, **MTTD**, and **first-action** SLAs.  
- Create **watchlists** and **custom detections**; schedule daily hunting reviews.  

**Estimated time:** 40 minutes  

===  

## CISO Overview - Scenario and goals

Zava Oil & Resources wants to improve SOC efficiency by defining consistent incident classification and severity, and by measuring **MTTD (Mean Time to Detect)** and **MTTR (Mean Time to Remediate)** using timestamps already available in the unified **Defender XDR** portal.  

The team must also create watchlists for high-value assets, add custom detections using **KQL**, and schedule daily hunting reviews.
