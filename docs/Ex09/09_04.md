# Task 04: Identity session revoke and SaaS download block

---

## Security Architecture Team  

1. Approve temporary account containment, whether disabling the account or revoking their sign-in session.

1. Approve session controls, like blocking downloads, for impacted users.

## Security Engineering and Administration  

1. At this point, you could revoke **Lab User One**'s sign in session and disable their account temporarily.

    {: .note }
    > Do not perform. In the SOC Analyst's tasks, you'll sign in with **Lab User One** to observe what the end user would see, following the **SoftDelete** purge.
    
1. You could then block downloads in a sanctioned app. There's a session policy already created in a prior exercise to do this.

## SOC Analyst  

From here, as the SOC Analyst, you could:

1. Attempt to access a SharePoint Online document to confirm the block.  

1. Navigate to **Incidents**, then add comments for: 

    - User sessions revoked  
    - Session policy applied (Blocked Downloads)  

1. Add closing notes:  

    - First action time  
    - Total time to contain  
    - Any user impact observed
