# Exercise 09: Runbooks and native automations

## Exercise learning objectives  

- Standardize actions for **MDO purge**, **MDE isolation and Live Response**, **MDI user disablement**, and **MDA session control**.  
- Configure **AIR auto-remediation** levels and approval flows.  
- Validate **human-in-the-loop** versus **hands-off** response scenarios.  

**Estimated time:** 30 minutes

## CISO Overview - Scenario and goals

A recent credential-phish slipped past first-layer defenses and reached a few users.  

Your mandate today is to standardize native response actions in **Defender XDR**-no custom playbooks-so the SOC can purge malicious mail, contain compromised endpoints, revoke risky user sessions, and enforce safer SaaS access in minutes.  

You'll tune **Automated Investigation & Response (AIR)**, validate human-in-the-loop approvals, and execute live runbooks that prove MTTR reduction without adding operational risk.  

**Success criteria:** consistent, repeatable, and auditable actions across email, endpoints, identities, and cloud apps-all inside the Defender XDR portal.
